      <div class="copy-column">
        <p>In this assignment, we were asked to look back and explore our relationship with nature. To design a future that is more tactile, phydital and human, we explored the relationship between nature and societal & technological change.</p>

      <h3>Understand</h3>

      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <p>In this phase, we explored a series of case studies that successfully bridged the gap between natural materials and technology.</p>
          <p>Our biggest inspiration was the installation Matières Sensibles, by Grégory Lasserre & Anaïs met den Ancxt, a series of sculptures made of veneer sheets of wood, which have sonorous touch zones that follow the veins of the wood — this allows the sculpture to produce sound when touched. The designers at Scenocosme are creating these interactive pieces to hybridize natural elements and technology by creating symbolic and sensorial relationships between the body and the natural environment. Thus, producing a sensitive, emotion-based relationship between the living and the natural elements, which are often viewed as “invisible” or “without feeling” through the use of touch, sight and sound.</p>
          <p>Based on the precedents analyzed, we tried to map out emotions that people interacting with such installations felt: </p>

          <ul class="list-with-bullets">
            <li><strong>Confusion</strong> through trying to figure out how the sounds correlate with the touch</li>
            <li><strong>Satisfaction</strong> through their unique composition of sounds</li>
            <li><strong>Wonder and respect</strong> for the natural component</li>
            <li><strong>Peace</strong> from the spectrum of frequencies given by the piece</li>
            <li><strong>Concentration</strong> when they try to identify where each sound lies on the piece</li>

          <div>
            <p>During the Define phase, we drew from the precedents, concepts and technologies and started brainstorming ways of storytelling "phyditally" — that is, by margin physical, natural materials with digital technology.</p>
            <p>It was at this point, looking at what nature represents and how it relates to technology that we started having conversations about how the trees in our cities have been standing there as witnesses to the changes around them. We, finally, narrowed it down to designing an installation that looks at trees as bystanders to societal development. </p><br />

      <h3>Decide</h3>

      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <p>With dozens of different ideas sketched out, we individually presented our concepts to the whole group and discussed different aspects of each. With the brief and goal in mind, we then ran a session of <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase4-decide/dot-vote" target="_blank"  class="text-link">Dot Vote</a>, where we achieved consensus on what our installation could become.</p>

          <h4>Chosen Concept</h4>

          <p>The concept we decided to go with was a three-walls immersive room with a tree stump in the middle. A single projected image spans through the three walls showing a specific point in time. By interacting with the tree stump, the user is able to change the image being projected — from the inner to the outer veins of the tree stump, the user is able to move from earliest to latest years — thus empathizing with the tree’s experience of witnessing the change in its environment through time.</p>

            <p>The second group, which I led, was responsible for designing the tactile interaction and the hardware/software architecture behind the touch.</p>
            <p>The interaction was designed by using capacitive touch sensors on one of the sides of the wood. Each sensor would correspond to years on a timeline carved on the other side of the wood.</p>
            <p>When the wood was touched, the Arduino would determine which of the terminals had been activated and send that information via JSON to our Javascript app running on the browser. The browser would then show the image corresponding to the year touched on the wood.</p>

          <p>We received amazingly positive feedback from the audience. Most of the attendees were impressed at how seamless the interaction between the touch and the feedback via projection was.</p>
          <p>We could see on people’s faces the wonder and satisfaction for not being interacting with a screen, but with physical natural material. Having the hardware 100% hidden was the highlight of our prototype.</p>
