      <h3>03. Method & Participants</h3>

      <div class="employers">
        <h4>A - Employers</h4>
        <p>Twenty design leaders in the design industry, from small, medium and large companies were interviewed. Some of their roles include Founders, CEOs, Directors, and Team Leads.</p>
        <p>Employers from a range of businesses sizes participated in the project:</p>
        <ul class="list-with-bullets">
          <li>13 leaders from <strong>small companies</strong> (1 to 99 employees);</li>
          <li>4 leaders from <strong>medium companies</strong> (100 to 499 employees);</li>
          <li>3 leaders from <strong>large companies</strong> (500 employees or more)</li>
        </ul> <br />

        <p>The interview process consisted of 2 steps: a pre-interview survey and the interview itself.</p>

        <h5>Survey</h5>

        <p>The pre-interview survey contained 27 questions, all of which asked employers to rank the importance of different soft skills (from Ontario's Essential Employability Skills sheet) for a designer, using a Likert Scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</p><br />

        <h6>Sample question:</h6>
        <div class="question-sample">
          <p>"CONFLICT RESOLUTION is an essential skill for a designer."</p>
          <ul class="list-with-bullets">
            <li>Strongly disagree</li>
            <li>Disagree</li>
            <li>Neither agree nor disagree</li>
            <li>Agree</li>
            <li>Strongly agree</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h5>Interview</h5>
        <p>Interviews were semi-structured, with 11 major questions, and lasted anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. The questions that were asked focused on the following aspects:</p>
        <ul class="list-with-bullets">
          <li>the employer’s opinion of the most important soft skills for a designer</li>
          <li>how prepared employers think junior designers are in regards to their soft skills</li>
          <li>a comparison between the soft skills of employees who have been hired straight out of post-secondary schools versus those who have more than 3 years of work experience</li>
          <li>any soft skills that employers felt designers (both junior and senior) could improve on.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Sample questions:</h6>
        <div class="question-sample">
          <ul class="list-with-bullets">
            <li>Do you feel that junior designers hired directly from college or university lack any soft skills compared to those with a job experience?</li>
            <li>In an interview process, what soft skills do you think are essential in a candidate? (meaning, you wouldn't hire them if they don't possess such skills)</li>
            <li>What soft skills do you feel junior designers need to improve on? </li>
            <li>What soft skills do you feel senior designers need to improve on?</li>
          </ul>

      </div>

      <div class="students">
        <h4>B - Students</h4>
        <p>Four focus groups were conducted, with a total of 20 students involved. Participants included both undergraduate and graduate students and were all enrolled at George Brown College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Students were enrolled in different semesters of various design programs including graphic design, interaction design and development, and digital media design.</p> <br />

        <h5>Focus Groups</h5>
        <p>The discussions with students focused on e-Learning and soft skills, and were approximately one hour in length. During student focus groups, information was gathered on students’ behaviour when using online videos, their experience with and impression of current e-Learning resources, their awareness of soft skills, and how they feel about their current level of soft skills. </p> <br />
        <p>We also aimed to gain insight into students opinions on how soft skills education can be improved for design students, whether it's possible to have soft skills education through online platforms, and if so, what would be a good way to implement it.</p>

        <h6>Sample discussion questions:</h6>
        <ul class="list-with-bullets">
          <li>Do you think e-learning videos are useful as a learning tool?</li>
          <li>What do you think of the content in e-learning platforms such as Lynda.com?</li>
          <li>How would you define soft skills?</li>
          <li>What soft skills do you think you should have to succeed in the industry?</li>
          <li>What engages you while learning?</li>
          <li>How can online learning content be improved to be more engaging?</li>
          <li>Do you think it’s possible to incorporate teaching and practice soft skills into e-learning platforms?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faculty">
        <h4>C - Faculty</h4>
        <p>Ten educators in the field of design were interviewed. All educators were faculty members at George Brown College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Educators taught students in various design programs including graphic design, visual effects, interaction design and development, and interactive media management.</p>

        <h5>Interviews</h5>
        <p>During interviews with design educators, we aimed to find out about their impression of current e-Learning resources, as well as if and how they utilize them in conjunction with their in-class coursework. We collected data regarding educators’ awareness of soft skills, their opinion of the most important soft skills for a designer, and their opinions on the strength of the soft skills of the students they have taught.</p>

        <h6>Questions sample:</h6>
        <ul class="list-with-bullets">
          <li>Do you use online videos to supplement your teaching? In what ways? (i.e.: in-class, or assigned homework)</li>
          <li>Which soft skills do you think are important for a designer to succeed in the industry?</li>
          <li>Are there any changes you would like to see in the curriculum to help students develop soft skills?</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>04. Synthesis & Analysis</h3>

      <p>After collecting all of the data, the interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed through NVivo. Coding was completed by multiple analysts to ensure inter-reliability. The interviews were coded through nodes that were based on the different EES (Essential Employability Skills). Some recurrent characteristics that employers often mentioned as an important soft skill, but were not part of the EES list, were also added as nodes, such as: Attitude, Confidence, Prioritize and Professionalism.</p> <br />
      <p>After all the interviews had been conducted and coding completed, data were analysed. In addition to the qualitative data, this phase provided two sets of quantitative data: firstly, a chart that quantified how frequently each soft skill was mentioned as essential to a designer; secondly, a chart that showcased the results of the likert scale survey.</p> <br />

          <h5>Interviews - Qualitative data</h5>
          <p>With so many hours of interviews, in this project we gathered tons of valuable qualitative data from employers. I'm gonna present some of the points that participants touched on that greatly influenced the final deliverables of the project. </p>

          <h6>Communication</h6>

          <p>Communication is the skill that design employers consider the most important for designers. They analysed the cycle of a designer in a company, from the interview to being an experienced representative of the design group in front of companies' executives. Here are some of their quotes:</p>

          <div class="interview-quotes">
            <q>We go back to communication as one of the key drivers of being a designer. I think if you can convince somebody that what you're proposing is a good idea and that it has value, and that it has tangible desirability, and that it's feasible, than you create a much more compelling case for why that should be implemented.</q>
            <q>Tell me the theory behind what it is that you’ve done and how you got to that theory. I think there is, from my experience, a real emphasis on ‘look at my final product’, whereas I wonder ‘ok, well how did you get there?’ That just comes down to good communication and what we’re looking for.</q>
            <q>As a designer if you can't communicate your ideas, that's it, you're dead, right?</q>
          </div>

          <h6>Team Work</h6>

          <p>Team work is the second most mentioned soft skill that employers consider important for designers to possess. According to design leaders, it is so important because designers often are responsible for being a bridge between different disciplines involved in the product's lifecycle:</p>

          <div class="interview-quotes">
            <q>I think most of the time, students are just concerned about the work and then when they get put into a work environment, they’re not really aware that there’s this whole other side of things, where things like collaboration are important and just being able to work with different people who have different attitudes or different backgrounds.</q>
            <q>(...) you see designers in finance, you see designers in health, you see designers in all these other disciplines. And the designer accesses this bridge between understanding of this disciplines and trying to make connections between them that people otherwise might not make. So, I think those are very tangible soft skills that are extremely important in building for the future of designers. </q>
            <q>(...) [a designer] is not going to solve a problem or conquer the world's problems on your own. It's a mentality of being, or thinking, that everyone is as collective going to succeed. Thinking about what you do as a team and not like as an individual.</q>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="students-findings">
        <h4>B - Students</h4>
        <p>Intro here.</p>

        <h5>What are soft skills for students?</h5>
        <div class="interview-quotes 2-col">
          <q>Skills that can't really be taught. You just learn by experience.</q>
          <q>They are skills that are not Adobe skills.</q>
          <q>How to behave when you're in a meeting, how to behave when you have some struggle with a client, especially in design teams where you need to constantly tell your client which way to follow and why you think that way.</q>
        </div>

        <h5>Thoughts on Classroom Education vs Online Education</h5>

        <p>Some students stated that their professors use online videos as a supplementary tool to a traditional classroom lecture in order for them to "re-learn" and further understand the course content. They also suggested that a traditional classroom setting can distracting and obtrusive to learning. Utilizing e-learning videos to supplement technical classes can help students better understand content and the skills required to excel in the course and/or program.</p>

        <div class="interview-quotes">
          <q>I think it’s easy to get distracted in class, especially if people are talking or you can’t really hear the prof. So, with a video you can just go back and you can fully hear.</q>
          <q>I think it also saves time for the professor, instead of them having to go step-by step. We can just review the videos at home and then ask any questions about it during class.</q>
          <q>For some classrooms, you can’t really hear or see properly, but for videos you have the demonstration happening right in front of you.</q>
        </div>


        <h5>Online Learning and Soft Skills</h5>

        <p>During the focus groups we found out that the unbiased opinion of students is that soft skills cannot be learned online.</p>

        <div class="interview-quotes">
          <q>[When I develop my soft skills, it’s mostly in-class. The benefit is because, I see you and you see me – I don’t get that when I’m learning something through Lynda.</q>
          <q>I would lean more towards in-class because I would like to get feedback and comments from the professor, and that’s not something you can do with the online videos.</q>
          <q>I feel like you lose a lot of the classroom dynamics during e-learning. I mean, how would you learn team work or presentation online?</q>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="faculty-findings">
        <h4>C - Faculty</h4>

        <h5>What are soft skills for faculty?</h5>
        <div class="interview-quotes 2-col">
          <q>So talking from my perspective, soft skills are the skills that students and people need to be successful in their life. They are different from our technical skills.</q>
          <q>I think that soft skills are things that are lifelong learning. No student can expect from George Brown [College] or any university or other college or institution that they will be perfect at soft skills.</q>
        </div>

        <h5>Views on Online Learning</h5>

        <p>As noticed in the students' focus group, faculty members also think that students would better thrive in a hybrid setting rather than full online learning. Although this may be true, there's a contrasting idea from another professor that when students have the accountability of taking the time to sit down and focus, online videos it might be a helpful tool for their learning:</p>

        <div class="interview-quotes">
          <q>I don't know, maybe this is just my perception but I do feel like elearning is good to a certain degree. I feel like if it's always e-learning, or videos, you just lose that applied skill. I feel that there needs to be a balance otherwise you can get lost in a video and never apply your skills. I feel like you need that sort of instructor to guide you in a direction, even as you apply those skills.</q>
          <q>You require self-discipline to be able to engagement and the barrier is that I think students are not learning self-discipline the hardest thing to learn early skills by taking an online tutorial for part of your course that helps you pass your GRE or whatever. It's going to really really help you is it how hard is to get yourself to sit in front of the screen when it's not something.</q>
          <q>When the [course] delivery is online, the accountability is on the students. When it's an in-class thing, they come to the class, they play with their phones, I can't engage for the whole three hours.  But if you're doing it in your own home, and you take the time to focus because the accountability is on you, you don't text and watch my videos, you are most likely just watching the video.</q>

      <h3>06. Triangulation</h3>
      <p>Having finalized the interviews and focus groups, we then started a triangulation analysis based on the synthesized and coded qualitative content of the three groups of participants. This analysis was crucial in defining where the viewpoints of different participants intersect.</p> <br />
      <p>One of the diagrams created in this phase was the visualization about the soft skills that each group consider the most essential to succeeding in the design industry:</p>

      <h3>07. Evaluation Framework for Online Courses</h3>

      <p>After extensive analysis of all the qualitative content, a framework was developed to help educators and content developers gauge the effectiveness of online courses in:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets">
        <li>Engaging students towards completion of the course;</li>
        <li>Promoting learning and practice of soft skills</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following five items were the top recommendations from students, educators, and employers on how to effectively utilize online videos for design-related disciplines.</p>

      <ol class="ordered-list one-col">
        <li>Optimal length of video between 5 and 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Gamified learning</li>
        <li>Embedded interaction with instructors</li>
        <li>Embedded collaboration between students towards completing assignments</li>
        <li>Exercises with soft skills related activities</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Whole courses or individual videos could be assessed based on the framework presented above, with their final score reflecting how effective it'll be in engaging students and promoting the learning & practice of the soft-skills that were most mentioned by employers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container project-content">
      <h3>08. Trial Application</h3>

      <p>Having created the assessment framework, the team started evaluating 4 online videos from different platforms. The videos were assess against each of the criteria. To each criterion, the video was given a score from 1 to 5.</p>

      <p>In this trial application, videos that had a minimum total score of of 60% (15 points, out of 25 points) were considered acceptable. The following rubric was employed when evaluating each of the criteria:</p>

      <h3>09. Limitations</h3>

      <p>Although we were able to gather enough data to provide us with a strong foundation for our facts, triangulation and framework, there were limitations that prevented us that expanding even more our horizons at the phase of data collection. They were:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets">
        <li>Because of difficulties with recruiting participants, we had limited data from employers in large companies.</li>
        <li>The impact from the 2017th strike in Ontario's colleges restricted our access to recruiting more students.</li>
        <li>We had access to a limited range of design programs, which prevented us from having participants from a broader design background.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>10. Next steps</h3>

      <p>The work towards a future where students are provided with a more engaging learning of soft-skills through online platforms does not end with this project. As one of my mentors frequently states: "Good research is always raising more questions for more research." </p><br />

      <p>Valuable information was gathered and made sense out of a pool of raw data from the different groups of participants. However, all our findings beg for more research in order to respond to the question which is the output of all that was unfolded in this project:</p>

      <div class="highlight ol">
        <p>How might we design an e-learning platform for design students in order to better engage them in learning and practicing communication, team work, critical thinking and problem solving – soft skills that are essencial for their future careers?</p>
