      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <p>After collecting all the data, the interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed on NVivo. Coding was done by multiple analysts to ensure inter-reliability. The interviews were coded through nodes that corresponded to the <a href="http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/pepg/audiences/colleges/progstan/essential.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">EES (Essential Employability Skills)</a>.</p>
          <p>After all the interviews had been conducted and their coding completed, we started analyzing all the information. In addition to the qualitative data, this phase provided two sets of quantitative data: firstly, a chart that quantified how frequently each soft skill was mentioned as essential to a designer; secondly, a chart that showcased the results of the Likert scale survey.</p>

          <h6>Communication</h6>
          <p class="copy-column">Communication is the skill that design employers consider the most important for designers - from junior to senior roles. Here are some of their thoughts:</p>

          <div class="interview-quotes">
            <q>We go back to communication as one of the key drivers of being a designer. I think if you can convince somebody that what you're proposing is a good idea and that it has value, and that it has tangible desirability, and that it's feasible, then you create a much more compelling case for why that should be implemented.</q>
            <q>Tell me the theory behind what it is that you’ve done and how you got to that theory. I think there is, from my experience, a real emphasis on ‘look at my final product’, whereas I wonder ‘ok, well how did you get there?’ That just comes down to good communication and what we’re looking for.</q>
            <q>As a designer if you can't communicate your ideas, that's it, you're dead, right?</q>
          </div>

          <h6>Team Work</h6>
          <p class="copy-column">Team work is the second most mentioned soft skill that employers consider important for designers to have. According to design leaders, collaboration is so important because designers often act as a bridge between different disciplines involved in a product's lifecycle:</p>

          <div class="interview-quotes">
            <q>I think most of the time, students are just concerned about the work and then when they get put into a work environment, they’re not really aware that there’s this whole other side of things, where things like collaboration are important and just being able to work with different people who have different attitudes or different backgrounds.</q>
            <q>(...) you see designers in finance, you see designers in health, you see designers in all these other disciplines. And the designer accesses this bridge between an understanding of these disciplines and trying to make connections between them that people otherwise might not make. So, I think those are very tangible soft skills that are extremely important in building for the future of designers. </q>
            <q>(...) [a designer] is not going to solve a problem or conquer the world's problems on your own. It's a mentality of being, or thinking, that everyone is as collective going to succeed. Thinking about what you do as a team and not like as an individual.</q>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <hr class="style-one">
      <div class="students-findings">
        <h4>Students</h4>

        <h5>What are soft skills for students?</h5>
        <div class="interview-quotes">
          <q>Skills that can't really be taught. You just learn by experience.</q>
          <q>Not Adobe skills.</q>
          <q>How to behave when you're in a meeting, how to behave when you have some struggle with a client, especially in design teams where you need to constantly tell your client which way to follow and why you think that way.</q>
        </div>

        <h5>Thoughts on Classroom Education vs Online Education</h5>

        <p class="copy-column">Some students talked about how traditional classroom settings can be distracting and obtrusive to learning. Utilizing e-learning videos to supplement technical classes can help students better understand the content and the skills required to excel in the course and/or program.</p>

        <div class="interview-quotes">
          <q>I think it’s easy to get distracted in class, especially if people are talking or you can’t really hear the prof. So, with a video, you can just go back and you can fully hear.</q>
          <q>I think it also saves time for the professor, instead of them having to go step-by-step. We can just review the videos at home and then ask any questions about it during class.</q>
          <q>For some classrooms, you can’t really hear or see properly, but for videos you have the demonstration happening right in front of you.</q>
        </div>


        <h5>Online Learning and Soft Skills</h5>

        <p class="copy-column">During the focus groups, we found out that the unbiased opinion of students is that soft skills cannot be learned online.</p>

        <div class="interview-quotes">
          <q>[When I develop my soft skills, it’s mostly in-class. The benefit is because I see you and you see me – I don’t get that when I’m learning something through Lynda.</q>
          <q>I would lean more towards in-class because I would like to get feedback and comments from the professor, and that’s not something you can do with the online videos.</q>
          <q>I feel like you lose a lot of the classroom dynamics during e-learning. I mean, how would you learn team work or presentation online?</q>
        </div>


      </div>
      <hr class="style-one">
      <div class="faculty-findings">
        <h4>Faculty</h4>

        <h5>What are soft skills for faculty?</h5>
        <div class="interview-quotes 2-col">
          <q>So talking from my perspective, soft skills are the skills that students and people need to be successful in their life. They are different from our technical skills.</q>
          <q>I think that soft skills are things that are lifelong learning. No student can expect from George Brown [College] or any university or other college or institution that they will be perfect at soft skills.</q>
        </div>

        <h5>Views on Online Learning</h5>

        <p class="copy-column">Most of the faculty members think that students would better thrive in a hybrid setting rather than full online learning. Although this may be true, there's a contrasting idea from another professor about the relationship between online learning and accountability:</p>

        <div class="interview-quotes">
          <q>I don't know, maybe this is just my perception but I do feel like e-learning is good to a certain degree. I feel like if it's always e-learning or videos, you just lose that applied skill. I feel that there needs to be a balance otherwise you can get lost in a video and never apply your skills. I feel like you need that sort of instructor to guide you in a direction, even as you apply those skills.</q>
          <q>You require self-discipline to be able to engage and the barrier is that I think students are not learning self-discipline the hardest thing to learn early skills by taking an online tutorial for part of your course that helps you pass your GRE or whatever. It's going to really really help you is it how hard is to get yourself to sit in front of the screen when it's not something.</q>
          <q>When the [course] delivery is online, the accountability is on the students. When it's an in-class thing, they come to the class, they play with their phones, I can't engage for the whole three hours.  But if you're doing it in your own home, and you take the time to focus because the accountability is on you, you don't text and watch my videos, you are most likely just watching the video.</q>

      <h3>Triangulation</h3>
      <p class="copy-column">Having finalized the interviews and focus groups, we then started a triangulation analysis based on the synthesized and coded qualitative content of the three groups of participants. This analysis was crucial in defining where the viewpoints of different participants intersect:</p>

      <h3>Evaluation Framework for Online Courses</h3>

      <p class="copy-column">Based on the qualitative research, a framework was developed to help educators and content developers gauge the effectiveness of online courses in:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets copy-column">
        <li>Engaging students towards completion of the course, and</li>
        <li>Promoting learning and practice of soft skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <br /><br />

      <p class="copy-column">The following five items were the top recommendations from students, educators, and employers on how to effectively utilize online videos for design-related disciplines.</p>

      <ol class="ordered-list one-col-centered">
        <li>Optimal length of video: between 5 and 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Gamified learning</li>
        <li>Embedded interaction with instructors</li>
        <li>Embedded collaboration between students towards completing assignments</li>
        <li>Exercises with soft skills related activities</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="copy-column">Whole courses and/or individual videos could be assessed using the framework presented above, in order to find out how effective they would be in engaging students and promoting the learning & practice of essential soft skills.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container project-content">
      <h3>Trial Application</h3>

      <p class="copy-column">Having created the assessment framework, the team evaluated 4 online videos from different platforms. For each criterion, the videos were given a score from 1 to 5.</p>

      <p class="copy-column">Videos that had a minimum total score of 60% (15 points, out of 25 points) were considered acceptable. The following rubric was employed:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets copy-column">
        <li><b>1 point:</b> Does not meet the criteria</li>
        <li><b>2 points:</b> Inconsistently meets the criteria and/or  soft skills activities are not intrinsic to completing the video</li>
        <li><b>3 points:</b> Meets the criteria, but could be more engaging</li>
        <li><b>4 points:</b> Meets the criteria and creates an engaging experience</li>
        <li><b>5 points:</b> Meets the criteria and excels at creating superiorly engaging and impactful soft skill activities</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="container project-content">
      <h3>Limitations</h3>
