        <h3>Literature Review</h3>
        <div class="copy-column">
          <div>
            <p>An emerging body of science indicates that making decisions may possess negative ramifications for controlling ones’ behaviour and the quality of subsequent decisions. Evidence suggests that individuals experiencing decision fatigue demonstrate an impaired ability to make trade-offs, prefer a passive role in the decision-making process, and often make choices that seem  impulsive or irrational (Pignatiello, Martin, & Hickman, 2018).</p>
            <p>Akin to muscle fatigue after exertion, humans deplete internal resources when performing acts of self-regulation, such as processing information to formulate a decision (Pignatiello et al., 2018).</p><br />
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>According to Hirshleifer, Levi, Lourie & Teoh, evidence in the psychology suggests that decisions made under pressure, distraction or fatigue, tend to be made heuristically - that is, using quick cognitive processes, thus affecting the quality of these decisions.</p>
            <p>Research also shows that awakening from sleep is followed by disrupted cerebral and cognitive functioning that lasts for at least the first half hour following awakening (Vallat, Meaner, Nicolar & Ruby, 2019).</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="literature-summary highlight tw">
        <ul class="three-column container">
          <li>Awaking is followed by disrupted cognitive functioning.</li>
          <li>Low-quality decisions are made when cognitively impaired.</li>
          <li>Non-heuristic decisions add up towards decision fatigue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="summary container">TThe literature review validates the assumption that removing the cognitive process of looking at the temperature, processing the information and rationalizing about the appropriate clothes might be beneficial. Literature suggests that giving users an easy and intuitive way of picking their clothes will improve their morning routine and help ensure that they won’t leave home under or overdressed.</p>

      <div class="copy-column">
        <p>An online survey was conducted with 20 Canadians from different regions within Canada, to gather quantitative data and identify different habits when checking the weather and planning what to wear on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>Three interviews were conducted with potential users to gather qualitative data about their morning routine and identify problems or missed opportunities.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Weather & Morning Routine Facts</h4>
      <div class="copy-column">
        <p>During the interviews, participants confirmed that checking the weather is one of their first activities right after waking up. Contrary to most participants, one interviewee stated that they don’t check the weather during the winter:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="interview-quotes">
        <q>If it’s middle of winter, I just put any heavy winter clothing. During any other season, I check the weather and dress accordingly.</q>
        <q>I wake up, get my phone, check the news, check Reddit, see how the temperature is and then I get up.</q>
        <q>I like to see the breakdown hour by hour so I know exactly what I need to bring to survive the day.</q>
      </div>


      <h4>Expectations & Current Apps</h4>
      <div class="copy-column">
        <p>Regarding their current weather apps (70% of the survey respondents use The Weather Network), all participants agree that they’re slow and cluttered. They also shared what information is important other than the temperature:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="interview-quotes">
        <q>I expect to see whether or not it’s gonna rain. Oh, and I also check the UV index. It doesn’t really matter for clothing, but I do like to know if it’s extremely bad and I’m gonna need sunscreen.</q>
        <q>There’s too much information. I just need to decide what I am going to wear but there is a lot of ads. Also, the breakdown of hourly or 36 hours is kinda confusing. </q>
        <q>They’re slow, too much information I don’t need, like news, ads and other user’s content. I don’t need to see images of people’s sunflowers.</q>

          <li>The main reason people use weather apps is to decide what to wear.</li>
          <li>People usually check the weather right after waking up.</li>
          <li>People are not decision-making efficient right after waking up.</li>
          <li>Although most people use weather apps every day, they’re usually not properly dressed for the current weather.</li>
          <li>The most used weather apps have too much information on them, are cluttered — and don’t actively help users make better decisions.</li>
          <li>Making heuristic decisions in the morning add up towards cognitive overload throughout the day.</li>

      <h3>Ideation</h3>

      <p class="copy-column">At the start of my ideation session, I took some time to review the goals, insights and constraints set by the research so far. I then put those facts into post-its and did a session of <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/crazy-eights" target="_blank">Crazy 8’s</a> and ended up with two solutions\.</p>


      <h4>Narrowing down</h4>
      <p class="copy-column">Having sketched out Solutions 1 and 2, I decided to share the early concepts with some friends for input. As I thought, Solution 1 wasn’t quite getting there, because of being text-heavy. I, then decided to prototype Solution 2 - which relies on minimal weather info and an illustration.</p>

      <h3>App Design - Phase 1</h3>

      <!-- TODO -->
      <!-- <p style="color:red">Include explanation to why the breakpoitns</p> -->

      <p class="copy-column">Ideally, having in mind the individuality of how each user experiences the weather, the design would feature a way for customizing the outfit depending on the temperature.</p>
      <p class="copy-column">But I had the constraint of having to develop a single-page app in one week. So, for the first prototype, I decided to interview a few friends to get a sense of the average breakpoint where they decide to dress lighter or heavier.</p>
      <p class="copy-column">The concept relies heavily on the Illustration so after identifying the breakpoints and the corresponding average outfits, I started to work on creating the character. These are the breakpoints and their corresponding outfits (temperature in Celsius):</p>

          <p>As the app relies on a quite simple interface, I decided to skip the high-fidelity wireframes and built a simple working prototype in Javascript.</p>

      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p class="copy-column">Three <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/" target="_blank">Think-Aloud</a> sessions were run with friends that had also participated in the questionnaire.</p>

      <h4>Tasks</h4>
      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>Decide what you should wear according to the current weather in your current location.</li>
        <li>Decide what you should wear in a specific city (-15º scenario).</li>
        <li>Decide what you should wear in a specific city (-5º scenario).</li>
        <li>Decide what you should wear in a specific city (5º scenario).</li>
        <li>Decide what you should wear in a specific city (15º scenario).</li>
        <li>Decide what you should wear in a specific city (25º scenario).</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <p class="copy-column">Context: Imagine you’re leaving home to a meeting in Kingston. You have to figure out what kind of clothes to wear according to the current weather in that city.</p>

      <div class="task-sample">
        <p class="box">Open the Thunderwear app.</p>
        <p class="box">Select the city "Kingston".</p>
        <p class="box">Tell the moderator what clothes you would pick according to the weather.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Recommendations</h4>

      <ol class="ordered-list recommendations-list">
        <li>Improve the Illustrations of scenarios "Less than 0º" & "Less than 10º" — most participants found it hard to identify the clothing difference.</li>
        <li>Visualize what are the accessories needed (including sunscreen, glasses, umbrella, etc).</li>
        <li>The app should start-up in the current location.</li>
        <li>There should be an easy way to come back to the current location.</li>
        <li>Add rain and snow to illustrations to minimize reading.</li>

      <h3>Limitations & Takeaways</h3>
      <div class="copy-column">
        <ul class="lessons-learned-list list-with-bullets">
          <li><b>Team Work: </b>Some stages of the process could have resulted in totally different ideas if I had a team to collaborate with — especially at the stage of ideation and concept design.</li>
          <li><b>Literature Review: </b>There isn't a huge amount of data about how small decisions affect the bigger picture of decision-fatigue (most of the studies I found are from 2017-2018).</li>
          <li><b>Target Audience: </b>Journey Maps would have helped communicate how Thunderwear impacts the mood and morning experience of the personas.</li>
          <li><b>Validation: </b>A bigger usability testing for a concept such as this one is ultimately necessary — here I was limited by time and resources. Benchmarking Thunderwear against traditional weather apps mentioned in the survey to measure the performance of the user when choosing their outfit would be an interesting metric.<br />It would also be valuable to look at the broader picture — in a scenario where someone uses Thunderwear on a daily basis, how does the improvement of that morning decision affect the overall mood or cognitive performance throughout the day?<br />Are avid users forgetting fewer accessories and leaving home better prepared for the current weather?</li>
